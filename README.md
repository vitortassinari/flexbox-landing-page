# flexbox-landing-page

This repository contains an exercise from the TOP Foundations Course, where I practice my Flexbox skills.
The goal is to build a simple landing page using a header, a footer, and a main content area.
I'm working on key Flexbox concepts like align-items, justify-content, and more.
